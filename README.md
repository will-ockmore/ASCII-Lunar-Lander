# ASCII-Lunar-Lander
A physics based Lunar Lander-like game. It has ASCII characters for graphics and runs in the command line. Built a long time ago (2011), it utilises physically accurate equations of motion and also accounts for the fuel you use! With procedurally generated mountains on the moon to fly over and a landing pad to aim for, the game even comes with 4 difficulty settings (number 4 is only possible with perfect play. Have fun with that).

Beware, this code probably has major flaws and is not guaranteed not to crash. It is however a pretty fun game.
